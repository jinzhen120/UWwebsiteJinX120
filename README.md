## Description

This was a website I've created for BIMD 233: Fundamentals of Web Media Technologies course. In the project, we used HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. This website was a framework for displaying different types media I've gathered for the purpose of website design experimentation.

NOTICE: This is an older site, so some of the media links have expired.
